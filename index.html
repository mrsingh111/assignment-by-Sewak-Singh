                <h3>CURRY</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                If your definition of comfort food is chicken curry and rice then you will know the importance it holds among millions and millions of people. Whether it is butter chicken, kadhai chicken, chicken tikka masala, home-made chicken korma or chicken gravy recipe, each dish is unique and caters to different taste buds. Succulent chunks of chicken simmering leisurely in a feisty gravy, sending off an inviting aroma that just cannot be ignored. A chicken curry is the ultimate crowd pleaser and an absolute must-have on an Indian dinner party menu.

              <h3>JUICE</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              It's summer and there is no better way to beat the heat and stay hydrated than juicing up. Loaded with essential minerals and fiber, fruits can work wonders to energise and refresh you in the scorching heat. And you needn't stick to plain old mono-flavoured juices reminiscent of packaged varieties to enjoy them. Go all out and shake up a spectacular range of fresh fruit juices by mixing and matching, and using herbs and spices to spruce things up a little.It's the perfect time to indulge and make the most of nature's sweet offerings by shaking up spectacular juices.

            <h3>SHAKE</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            When it comes to having your cake and eating it too, why not drink it as well? Milkshakes on a hot day (or, heck, we love them even in the dead of winter, like this sugar cookie milkshake) are some of our favorite desserts. They're creamy, dreamy, and only get better mixed with all our favorite crumbled cookies, pies, and brownies. We even love how cereal has inspired some of our favorite shake flavors, like our Fruity Pebbles milkshake and Cap'n Crunch milkshake.
